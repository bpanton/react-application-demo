# react-demo-application

This is a basic react demo application which use the SpeechRecognition interface of the Web Speech API 
(https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Speech_API). This is experimental technology and browser support is currently limited. This particluar application was built and tested using Chrome.

Speech input is taken as [Year : Make : Model] for vehicle information. ex. 1968 Ford Mustang. This input is used to call the CarQueryAPI 
(http://www.carqueryapi.com/documentation/api-usage/) in order to display detailed vehicle information.
